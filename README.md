# CalendarApp

A feature-rich calendar web app with support for multiple profiles, recurring events, and fuzzy search.

## Features

- **Multiple Profiles & Calendars:**
  - Create, delete, and manage multiple user profiles, each with their own password.
  - Each profile can have multiple calendars (subprofiles).

- **Event Management:**
  - Add, edit, and delete events.
  - Support for all-day and timed events.
  - Color-code events.

- **Recurring Events:**
  - Create events that repeat daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, hourly, or on a custom schedule.
  - Delete a single occurrence or the entire series for recurring events.

- **Fuzzy Search:**
  - Search for events by title, description, or location using typo-tolerant fuzzy search (powered by Fuse.js).
  - Search bar is always available at the top right of the calendar.

- **Import/Export:**
  - Import and export events in iCal (.ics) format.

- **Print:**
  - Print the current calendar view with profile/calendar info.

- **Dark/Light Mode:**
  - Toggle between dark and light themes.

## Setup & Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
2. **Open the website in your browser using the link provided by Github**
   - No build step or server required; all data is stored in your browser's localStorage.
3. **Create a Profile**
   - Use the "New Profile" button, set a password, and start adding calendars.
   **Create a Calendar**
   - Use the "New Calendar" button, enter your password for the calendar you are creating it in, set a name for your calendar, and start adding events.
4. **Search for Events**
   - Use the search bar at the top right. Typo-tolerant: e.g., searching "tesiting" will find "testing".
5. **Recurring Events**
   - When creating/editing an event, set the "Repeat" option. You can delete just one occurrence or the whole series.

## Notes
- All data is stored locally in your browser. Clearing browser storage will erase all profiles and events.
- For best experience, use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Arc, Opera, Dia).
